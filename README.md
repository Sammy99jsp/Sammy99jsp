I'm Sam(my) \[he/him], and I do a few things:
- Project Lead for [the AvdanOS Project](https://github.com/Avdan-OS)
- Web development (Svelte, React + Node.JS/Rust)
- AI image and video generation with Stable Diffusion (and ComfyUI)
- Occasional electronics tinkerer -- RaspPis, Arduinos, etc.

I'm currently learning:
- The inner workings of the modern Linux desktop, mainly:
  - [Wayland and XDG Protocols](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html),
  - [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/)
- Mid-to-Advanced level Rust code practices
- Language Design (see [AvPony](https://github.com/Sammy99jsp/AvPony))

I'm looking to collaborate on:
- AvdanOS, of course! Here are a few things we're doing as part of our project:
  - Configuration -- easy-to-understand config file syntax, with friendly and *helpful* error messages.
  - Documentation -- can we make all of our documentation part of the build system as a whole?
  - Developer Experience -- how can we make developing for AvdanOS (and Linux as a whole) as satisfying as possible?
